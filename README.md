To-Do Demo
==========

This app was built in a few days as a demonstration for a prospective employer. It could use a few improvements, but works well as far as I know.

Future Improvements
-------------------

- Streamline JS library includes â€“ both minified and development versions of some libraries are included in this repo.
- Use a placeholder instead of regular text for the contenteditable div elements.
- Style the app better, especially re: alignment.
